			<p>As a young girl I was mischievous, imaginative, and strong-willed. I was considered a tomboy by my family and friends because I enjoyed outdoor activities and taking things apart. I enjoyed playing with action figures and would hide my sisters Barbie dolls so that she wouldn’t have a choice but to play what I wanted. But my favorite times were spent working with my dad on projects, whether it was changing the oil on our vehicles, working on an air conditioner, putting a sprinkler system in or simply mowing the lawn. My time with him provided ample opportunities for me to ask “How” or “Why” and taught me hard work, perseverance, integrity and to always put forth my best effort in everything I did.</p>

			<p>Both my parents encouraged me and gave me the needed ‘push’ to excel when I felt overwhelmed and wanted to give up, always re-instilling the character traits they worked so hard to teach me. I was often told “you will reap what you sow.” I knew when I got older I wanted to get married and have kids and a home, but I hadn’t put much thought into how I was going to get there. Being a goal oriented individual, I figured I needed to focus on school to see my dreams come to fruition.<p>

			<p>Before I knew it, I was a junior in high school and it was time to apply for college. Since I knew I couldn’t be a pilot because of poor vision, I had to pick an alternate career, but what? I couldn’t make up my mind so I looked at it in a different perspective: what didn’t I want to be? I discovered that was much easier and instantly knew engineering was the field I was going to pursue. I had always enjoyed math and science and my fascination with disassembling components lead to an interest in design.</p>
